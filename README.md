Example of using Scala type system to detect measuring units mismatch at compile time

This is a small illustration of how rich static type system in a programming language (e.g. Scala) may be utilized to prevent users from mixing different measuring units (e.g. Imperial and Metric) in computations. Inspired by a [narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure) of Mars Climate Orbiter crash.
